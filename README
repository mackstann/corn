Corn is a small music playing daemon, forked from Quark.  It communicates via
D-BUS, adhering to the MPRIS spec for interoperability with frontends and
utilities that support MPRIS.

Playing songs with non-english filenames
----------------------------------------

If you want to play files that are not named in UTF-8 encoding and contain
non-ascii characters, then you will have to pull some strings to make Corn load
them.

Setting environment variables as shown here can make Corn work with them:

export G_BROKEN_FILENAMES=0  # this says that your filenames are not UTF-8
export CHARSET=ISO_8859-1    # this tells Corn what charset your files are
                             # using, change its value as appropriate

Alternately, you can rename your files to use UTF-8 characters.
