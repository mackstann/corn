Playing songs with non-english filenames
----------------------------------------

If you want to play files that are not named in UTF-8 encoding and contain
non-ascii characters, then you will have to pull some strings to make Quark
load them.

Seting environment variables as shown here can make Quark work with them:

export G_BROKEN_FILENAMES=0  # this says that your filenames are not UTF-8
export CHARSET=ISO_8859-1    # this tells Quark what charset your files are
                             # using, change its value as appropriate

Alternately, you can rename your files to use UTF-8 characters. :)
